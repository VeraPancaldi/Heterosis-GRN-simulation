Heterosis-GRN-simulation
========================

R code of a gene regulatory network simulation of hybrid vigour
This code is used to simulate the evolution of a population of diploid individuals.
Once the population is split into two and the two subgroups are allowed to evolve separately (becoming inbreds), hybrids can be made.
Hybrids can be formed and their fitness is compared to the fitness of their parents.
